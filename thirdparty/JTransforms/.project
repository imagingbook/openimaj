	<comment>JTransforms is the first, open source, multithreaded FFT library written 
      in pure Java. Currently, four types of transforms are available: 
      Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), 
      Discrete Sine Transform (DST) and Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT). 
      The code is derived from General Purpose FFT Package written by 
      Takuya Ooura and from Java FFTPack written by Baoshe Zhang. This 
      version has been modified to daemonize threads and stop any application 
      using the library waiting after execution has finished, and is based on
      revision 29 of the svn version of the code from 2014-05-18. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
